The campus is located on the eastern shore of Lake Biwa, in Hikone City, making a perfect fit into a magnificent landscape with the background of Mt. Ibuki to the north, the Suzuka mountains to the east, and the Hira mountains across the lake to the west. Surrounded by beautiful nature, the campus is traversed by moats and streams whose waters connect with Lake Biwa. Inside the main circular moat are the school symbol Pencil Tower, the library, a cafeteria, lecture rooms, and administration offices. Outside the moat are the four main schools of the university (with thirteen departments) and four graduate schools (with nine divisions). About 2,800 undergraduates study general education courses along with school and department specific courses. The common idea for all studies is To learn how to live in nature with harmony. Students can learn not only on campus, but also from Lake Biwa and the region around it, which is traditionally known as Ohmi. To study and experience the Ohmi region, USP instituted Ohmi Gakushi (Ohmi Bachelor) as an undergraduate course in the Department of Regional Studies and Ohmi Kanjin, (Ohmi sub major) as a graduate course in the Division of Regional Studies. Students learn basic knowledge of cultural activities in Ohmi Gakushi and participate in practical aspects in Ohmi Kanjin. In an extracurricular activity called Ohmi Rakuza, approximately 400 to 500 students every year volunteer to work in regional communities to resolve local problems. We provide education, research and regional contribution based on the theme Rooted in the region, studying the region, contributing to the region.

12,CHN,0.733615715,"Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences","The Institute of Modern Physics (IMP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was founded in l957. As of 2013, the institute had 892 staff members including 403 researchers, as well as 284 master's and doctoral students. IMP operates the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL), which consists of the Sector Focusing Cyclotron, the Separated Sector Cyclotron, the Cooler Storage Ring (CSR), and a number of experimental terminals. After a half century of development, IMP has become the most important research center for heavy ion sciences in China. We have established active and fruitful collaboration with more than 40 institutions worldwide. As a national laboratory, HIRFL is open to domestic and international users. HIRFL produces medium and high energy ion beams from proton to uranium. In recent years, HIRFL has operated 7,000 hours each year and delivered 5,000 hours of beam time for experiments. To improve HIRFL?s beam intensity and operating efficiency, IMP has devoted much effort to accelerator physics and technology R&D. Using HIRFL, we conduct fundamental research in nuclear and atomic physics. IMP?s main research focuses on nuclear reactions, nuclear spectroscopy, the properties of nuclear matter, the chemistry of super heavy elements and synthesis of new super heavy isotopes, key reactions in stellar evolution, high energy density physics, and highly charged heavy ion interactions. After the CSR was put into operation in 2008, IMP set making precision mass measurements of short lived nuclides as its highest priority research program at HIRFL. A batch of nuclear masses were measured with a precision of up to 10.7 using isochronous mass spectrometry, and the implications for nuclear structures and nucleosynthesis in the rapid proton capture process of X ray bursts have been investigated. So far, this research has led to three main conclusions. 64 Ge is certainly not a major waiting point in the rapid proton capture process in X ray bursts. Aided by model calculations, no strong Ca Sc cycle can be formed in X ray bursts. Last but not least, a breakdown of the quadratic form of the mass equation for analogous states was found. We have paid much attention to heavy ion applications. Cancer therapy has been developed at IMP since 2006, and so far 103 shallow seated and 110 deep seated tumor patients have been treated. In collaboration with local government agencies and hospitals, two dedicated heavy ion treatment facilities are under construction in Lanzhou and Wuwei in Gansu Province. Mutation of sweet sorghum using heavy ion beam irradiation technology has also proved to be very successful. An early maturity variety was isolated, and we expect large scale planting in western China to benefit many people. It is also worth noting that HIRFL provides an important platform for evaluating single particle effects for devices used in space, and contributes to space sciences in China. Another important application field is material irradiation, which may play a significant role in future nuclear energy development. In 2010, IMP took charge of the Advanced Nuclear Fission Energy Program ADS Transmutation System, a strategic priority research program of CAS. In collaboration with other institutes in China, the project was approved by the central government at the end of 2010. This long term project aims to build a demonstration facility for the transmutation of nuclear waste produced in nuclear power plants. IMP established a department dedicated exclusively to the R&D of a high intensity superconducting proton accelerator and spallation target system. Now the roadmap for the ADS project is fixed and the research program is on track.",713

31,CMR,-1.204059,Universite de Buea,"The University of Buea was born in 1993 following wideranging university reforms in Cameroon. Conceived in the Englishspeaking tradition, the University of Buea seeks to foster the essence of that system, while situating itself within the larger bilingual and multicultural context of Cameroon. It is located in the historic town of Buea, former capital of German Kamerun, former capital of the federated State of West Cameroon and now the provincial capital of the South West Region of Cameroon. Although the University draws its students mainly from the Englishspeaking part of Cameroon, it also serves the other provinces of the country. The mission of the University of Buea is to provide opportunities for quality education through teaching and research in an environment that is conducive to such pursuits and in ways that respond to market forces. The University is dedicated to the continuous quest for excellence, the promotion of moral and human values, and service to the community. Its teaching and research programmes emphasize relevance, encourage tolerance and promote creative, critical and independent thinking. The University of Buea is dedicated to the provision of programmes of study and research of the highest standards. It also produces high quality graduates with skills to satisfy the ever increasing demand of the Cameroonian, African and international job markets. The academic staff hold advanced qualifications and several possess international reputations. The student population is over 12,000, including over fifty who are physically and visually disabled. Adequate welfare provision for this later category of students remains both a challenge and a priority for the university administration. The University of Buea is made up of five faculties (Arts Education  Health Sciences  Science  and Social and Management Sciences) and one professional school, the Advanced School of Translators and Interpreters, (ASTI). As in most English specking institutions, the governance system of the university is based on concentration and devolution of management, with structures such as Council, Senate, Congregation and Committees on which staff and students are represented. This has enabled the University to make considerable strides and to be recognized as a progressive African University of choice. A highly qualified and diversified staff (about 300 permanent and 200 parttime) cater for the over 12,000 students, together with our partners in more than 40 universities in Africa, Europe and North America. In addition to teaching, the staff undertake research in diverse fields that are relevant to national development. In addition to the academic staff, UB also has about 473 support staff. Training at the University of Buea is supported by modest infrastructure including lecture halls, teaching and research laboratories, amongst others. For effective implementation of the New Policy on University Governance which lays emphasis on effectiveness, efficiency and management principles based on rigor, transparency and results, the University is connected to the outside world via a fibre optic link to Camtel, a major local telecommunications company. The main campus also has a fibre optic network that interconnects most of the buildings on campus. In keeping with the New University Governance Policy of Cameroon, the outreach activities of the University are increasingly involving the private sector in funding and training so as to ensure that the graduates are relevant to the labour market.

As a Catholic university it welcomes those of all beliefs and traditions who share its concerns for scholarship, justice, truth and freedom, and it values the diversity which their membership brings to the university community. Fairfield educates its students through a variety of scholarly and professional disciplines. All of its schools share a liberal and humanistic perspective and a commitment to excellence. Fairfield encourages a respect for all the disciplinestheir similarities, their differences, and their interrelationships. In particular, in its undergraduate schools it provides all students with a broadly based general education curriculum with a special emphasis on the traditional humanities as a complement to the more specialized preparation in disciplines and professions provided by the major programs. Fairfield is also committed to the needs of society for liberally educated professionals. It meets the needs of its students to assume positions in this society through its undergraduate and graduate professional schools and programs. A Fairfield education is a liberal education, characterized by its breadth and depth. It offers opportunities for individual and common reflection, and it provides training in such essential human skills as analysis, synthesis, and communication. The liberally educated person is able to assimilate and organize facts, to evaluate knowledge, to identify issues, to use appropriate methods of reasoning and to convey conclusions persuasively in written and spoken word. Equally essential to liberal education is the development of the esthetic dimension of human nature, the power to imagine, to intuit, to create, and to appreciate. In its fullest sense liberal education initiates students at a mature level into their culture, its past, its present and its future. Fairfield recognizes that learning is a life long process and sees the education which it provides as the foundation upon which its students may continue to build within their chosen areas of scholarly study or professional development. It also seeks to foster in its students a continuing intellectual curiosity and a desire for selfeducation which will extend to the broad range of areas to which they have been introduced in their studies. As a community of scholars, Fairfield gladly joins in the broader task of expanding human knowledge and deepening human understanding, and to this end it encourages and supports the scholarly research and artistic production of its faculty and students. Fairfield has a further obligation to the wider community of which it is a part, to share with its neighbors its resources and its special expertise for the betterment of the community as a whole. Faculty and students are encouraged to participate in the larger community through service and academic activities. But most of all, Fairfield serves the wider community by educating its students to be socially aware and morally responsible persons. Fairfield University values each of its students as an individual with unique abilities and potentials, and it respects the personal and academic freedom of all its members. At the same time it seeks to develop a greater sense of community within itself, a sense that all of its members belong to and are involved in the University, sharing common goals and a common commitment to truth and justice, and manifesting in their lives the common concern for others which is the obligation of all educated, mature human beings.",722

58,USA,1.687701277,Colgate University,"Colgate's mission is to provide a demanding, expansive, educational experience to a select group of diverse, talented, intellectually sophisticated students who are capable of challenging themselves, their peers, and their teachers in a setting that brings together living and learning. The purpose of the university is to develop wise, thoughtful, critical thinkers and perceptive leaders by challenging young men and women to fulfill their potential through residence in a community that values intellectual rigor and respects the complexity of human understanding. Profesor Jeff Barry walks students through a problem set on the board.Colgate University is a small highly selective residential liberal arts college for men and women of talent who are preparing for lives of leadership and productive citizenship. The Colgate faculty is a community of scholars committed to teaching in the classroom, the laboratory, the studio, and the library. Teaching is Colgate's first responsibility, serving not only to transmit knowledge but also to transform and extend it through a demanding, imaginative curriculum. Faculty scholarship complements teaching as it advances knowledge. Colgate maintains that ideal size which allows students to work closely with the faculty  it is neither a giant research university nor a tiny liberal arts college. The dialogue between faculty and students provides exciting opportunities for independent work.  As a residential college, Colgate is committed to the belief that learning takes place in many settings. Learning must serve life, and the opportunity to live together in a variety of settings encourages interpersonal exploration, expands mutual understanding, and supports a broadened perspective within a caring, humane community. The residential community provides a setting in which students gain maturity by taking responsibility for their actions and by coming to understand the impact of those actions upon others in an environment that is neither permissive nor authoritarian, but conducive to purposeful engagement. Colgate is an inclusive institution with diverse students and faculty. With a mission to educate leaders who will and must come from all societal groups, Colgate is committed to educate students to virtue and encourages them to respond openly and sensitively to others who are different from themselves. Within the limitations of its resources, Colgate extends opportunities to academically qualified students without regard to their ability to finance their education. While we celebrate our diversity, we function as one institution. Although we work together for the success of the university, we also recognize that our differences enrich the experiences of all of us. Groups that lead a separate existence do not support the whole, and those who forsake their culture impoverish all, depriving us of the richness of America's cultural background. We celebrate that difficult balance between the commonalities of human experience and the particularities of our individual lives. Student making an observation from his seat during class.The sense of community that begins in student/faculty dialogue and continues in the residential college is furthered by Colgate's general education program. The faculty at Colgate are deeply committed to the idea that the common experience of a shared core curriculum provides the foundation for dialogue both in the classroom and in campus residences. Students and faculty engage those persistent questions and problems that are general to human life as well as new questions raised by technological developments and the proliferation of knowledge. General education at Colgate focuses on questions that transcend disciplinary interests and lie at the intersection of the social, political, economic, and philosophical transformations that have marked the 20th century. To understand the human condition and the world in which we live requires both analysis and synthesis. We divide knowledge into manageable pieces to achieve understanding in depth, and we integrate the particular to achieve general understanding. Colgate offers a broad array of academic majors, both disciplinary and interdisciplinary, to assure learning in depth, while the program of general education synthesizes the insights of the disciplines into a more coherent understanding of human experience. The general education sequence of courses takes students not only to various historical moments but also to a variety of social and cultural locations. Colgate puts different cultures, Western and non Western, in conversation with one another in order that students might see that culture, like the human condition, is not given a priori  it is learned. In order to build upon the knowledge gained in the general education program and to enable students to increase their capacity to view their own culture and to learn how others see us, Colgate annually offers an extensive array of faculty directed study abroad programs in more than twenty locations in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Orientation programs enable students, regardless of their area of study, to prepare for study abroad by examining what it means to live in another culture, and they share their experiences when they return to campus. Almost half of each class participates in some form of off campus study during their undergraduate career. Students perform the NutcrackerRecognizing that we know the world in many ways, Colgate educates the whole person. Those ways of knowing include the engagement of both mind and body with the external world. The fine and performing arts add the challenge of selfdiscipline and selfexpression to the Colgate experience. The arts, which lie at the center of our eternal reinvention of culture, engage students' creative capacities and enhance their understanding of the world even as they entertain us. With flourishing programs both curricular and extracurricular in writing, music, the visual arts, theater, and dance, Colgate is continually enriched by the talents of its students and faculty. In like manner, the exhilaration of physical challenge, the value of group effort to achieve common ends, and the confidence that comes with developing the skills we need to participate in a lifetime of healthy activity are brought together in challenging athletic and outdoor recreational programs that encourage students to develop their personal potential and experience the cohesion of shared purpose. Finally, Colgate recognizes that those who lead are obligated to help others in need. That obligation must be nurtured, especially in a society that stresses the personal over the communal. Colgate is a nonsectarian institution, but it emphasizes individual and social responsibility to serve the less fortunate. Colgate engages this obligation through an extensive program of service learning and through fostering an ethos that balances individual freedom with social good. Service activities increasingly enhance classroom understanding of social institutions and their expression. In sum, the mission of Colgate University is to create and nurture an environment most conducive to the creation of self knowledge and public knowledge.",700
